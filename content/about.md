I'm a computer science graduate with a specialisation in cyber security. I spend my time helping real estate agencies build their online presence, improving my [NixOS configuration](https://github.com/different-name/nix-files) and writing posts here on my blog!

My hobbies include 3D modelling, playing online games, and experimenting with *(and often breaking)* Linux.

Have a look at my current projects on the [/home/](@/_index.md#current-projects) page, or browse my latest posts in the [/blog/](@/blog/_index.md) section.
